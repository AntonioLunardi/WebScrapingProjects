# WebScrapingProjects
Collections of projects developed by myself based on online courses, university specialization and general studies

### baixaDadosPortalTransparencia.sh
Developed as an exercise from UFPR DSBD specilization. The user can use a monthly flexible period of time 
to download databases of payments and debts from the website of the brazilian federal government 
https://portaldatransparencia.gov.br/download-de-dados/despesas. All files of each day will be unziped, only the 
relevant for the analisys will not be excluded and there will be two resultant csv files with only the header and
concatenated data of the selected days.

### extraction_api_datalab.py
Scraping from a figurative shopping website that also simulates twitter responses.
